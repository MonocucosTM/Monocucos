<p align="center">
We are a children's project created to implement values though fun and imagination. Our messages focus on tolerance and social acceptance; we want to become the starting point of a new way of thinking, communicating the invaluable impact that being accepting can heavily influence the construction of a better future society.
<p align="center">
We see acceptance through individuality, diversity, our differences and tolerance.
<p align="center">
We do not see a world in which one is to be black or white.
<p align="center">
Our language is that of colours and what they tell us:
Difference, complement, emotions, tones, signs and languages.
<p align="center">
Monocucos are __"Acceptance in Colours".__
<p align="center">
An acceptance which allows us to see new combinations for expressing worlds filled with nuances.
<p align="center">
We are looking to  spread our message to as many children as possible. We are more than sure that our philosophy can become an important tool to help the formation of a child since a young age, and while growing, he or she can become a true advocate for change in society.
