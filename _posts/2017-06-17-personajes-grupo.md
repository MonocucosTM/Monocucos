## "A world for all where we are all one".

## "Un mundo para todos donde todos somos uno".
 
## "Jeden świat dla wszystkich gdzie wszyscy jesteśmy jednym światem".


**Together we have the Power to change the world.**  
MONOCUCOS is an amazing family of 14 that will teach you how to have fun because they all are different. We talk about values, like **inclusion, diversity, tolerance, individuality, acceptance, and love**; in order to be part of a new thought of coexistence that builds a better society in the future.
The nature of our project is fully adaptive, that is, MONOCUCOS will take the form that society requires, to transmit its message to children regardless of their socio-economic status or geographic location.

literary proposal goes beyond its own limits working the values and

all that they can do for each other. It is a pleasure to have you with us
as part of our pedagogical proposal.”
