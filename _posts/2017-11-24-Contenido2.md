### Changing the world around the world. Coaching for kids about individuality, diversity, differences and tolerance.It is a part of the project that originates with the intention of becoming a didactic support tool for the transmission of "the Monocucos values" within educational communities. Inspired by the pillars of modern education (Knowing, Doing, Living Together,Ser) and based on playful and fun processes we want to be part of the construction of a new thought in early childhood children. (interactive workshops) -Educational Guides (Teaching material developed by experts as a guide and pedagogical support)  -Educational Module (Curricular grid to implement in formal and non-formal education)
